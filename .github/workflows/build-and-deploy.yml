            🤖 **Production build completed and ready for deployment!**

            This PR contains the latest production build files that need to be deployed to the `remote-build` branch.

            **📦 Built Files:**
            - `index.html` - Single HTML file with everything included
            - `bundle.js` - Bundled JavaScript

            **🔧 Build Details:**
            - Source commit: `${{ github.sha }}`
            - Triggered by: `${{ github.event_name }}`
            - Build timestamp: `${{ github.event.head_commit.timestamp }}`

            **📋 Next Steps:**
            1. ✅ Review the build files
            2. ✅ Merge this PR to master
            3. 🚀 Manually deploy to `remote-build` branch (since it's protected)

            **💡 Note:** The `remote-build` branch is protected, so deployment requires manual intervention.
